## Filing an Auto Claim
Report the accident to your insurer as soon as possible. Provide the date, location, and parties involved.
Keep photos, police report number, and repair estimates.

## Liability vs Collision
Liability pays for injuries/damages you cause to others. Collision helps repair your vehicle after a crash.
