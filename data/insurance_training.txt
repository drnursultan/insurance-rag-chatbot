Insurance Training Summary

1. What is Insurance?
Insurance provides financial protection against specific risks by pooling funds from many people. The insured pays premiums, and the insurer compensates for covered losses.

2. Key Insurance Principles
- Risk pooling: spreading risk among a large group.
- Utmost good faith: both parties must be honest.
- Indemnity: compensation restores, not enriches.
- Insurable interest: must have stake in the insured subject.

3. Types of Insurance
First-Party Insurance covers the insured’s own property (home, car, health).
Third-Party Insurance covers liability to others (e.g., auto liability, professional liability).

Examples:
- First-Party: Comprehensive Auto, Homeowners Property, PIP (Personal Injury Protection).
- Third-Party: CGL (Commercial General Liability), Product Liability, Professional Liability.

4. Key Parts of a Policy
- Declarations Page: names, dates, limits, premiums.
- Insuring Agreement: what’s covered.
- Exclusions: what’s not covered.
- Conditions: duties and responsibilities.
- Endorsements: modifications to coverage.

5. The Insuring Grant
This defines what the insurer agrees to do — usually to defend and indemnify against claims of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence (accident). Even false or baseless claims must be defended.

6. Duty to Defend vs. Duty to Indemnify
- Duty to Defend: based on allegations, even if untrue.
- Duty to Indemnify: based on actual proven facts.

7. Common Claims Excluded
- Lost income, reputation, or goodwill.
- Breach of contract (unless insured contract).
- Intentional harm or fraud.
- Government penalties or fines.
- Damage to the insured’s own work or property.
- Workers’ compensation obligations.
- Auto, watercraft, or aircraft usage.

8. “Occurrence” Requirement
Coverage only applies when the incident is accidental, unexpected, or unforeseen from the insured’s perspective.

9. Burdens of Proof
- The insured must show the claim is within coverage.
- The insurer must prove exclusions apply.
Ambiguities are interpreted in favor of the insured.

10. Conditions
- Notice: prompt reporting of accidents or lawsuits.
- Cooperation: the insured must assist in the investigation.
- No voluntary payments: insured cannot settle without insurer consent.

Late Notice:
If delay ≤ 2 years → insurer must show prejudice.
If delay > 2 years → insured must prove no prejudice occurred.

11. Coverage B — Personal and Advertising Injury
Covers specific intentional torts like:
- False arrest or imprisonment
- Malicious prosecution
- Wrongful eviction
- Libel, slander, invasion of privacy
- Copyright or trade dress infringement
- Using another’s advertising idea

12. Suit Limitation
Policies can limit the time to sue an insurer (sometimes as short as 1 year). In New York, bodily injury disclaimers must be issued within a reasonable time (≈30 days).

13. N.Y. Insurance Law § 3420
Insurers must promptly notify claimants and copy them on disclaimers for bodily injury or death. Failure to do so invalidates disclaimers for those claimants.

14. Systematic Approach for Coverage Analysis
Step 1: Review the claim — what is alleged?
Step 2: Read the insuring agreement — bodily injury? property damage? occurrence?
Step 3: Check exclusions — do any apply?
Step 4: Review conditions — was notice/cooperation timely?
Step 5: Verify timing — was disclaimer issued promptly?
Step 6: Conduct legal research — is the exclusion enforceable?

15. Common Terminology
- Deductible: amount the insured pays before insurer covers.
- Premium: regular payment to maintain coverage.
- Limit: maximum the insurer will pay.
- Policy period: active coverage timeframe.
- Claim: formal request for coverage under the policy.

16. Risk Management Tips
- Always read your policy carefully.
- Understand what is and isn’t covered.
- Report incidents promptly.
- Keep documentation of all communications.
- Avoid assumptions — verify with your agent.

17. Quick Reference Summary
- Insurance = protection through pooled risk.
- Policy = contract with rights and obligations.
- Coverage analysis = understand grant, exclusions, conditions.
- Be proactive: early notice prevents claim denial.
