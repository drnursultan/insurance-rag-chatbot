Understanding Insurance Coverage

Liability coverage protects you if you cause injury or property damage to others. It is required by law in most states. It includes:
- Bodily injury liability: covers medical expenses for injured parties.
- Property damage liability: pays for repairs to the other vehicle or property.

Collision coverage pays for repairs to your own vehicle after an accident, regardless of fault.

Comprehensive coverage protects against theft, vandalism, natural disasters, or animal collisions.

Uninsured motorist coverage helps if the other driver does not have insurance.

For homeowners:
- Dwelling coverage protects the structure of your home.
- Personal property coverage replaces stolen or damaged items.
- Additional living expenses (ALE) pay for temporary housing while your home is being repaired.

Itâ€™s important to review your coverage annually and adjust limits based on vehicle value, inflation, or life events such as marriage or moving.
