Filing an Insurance Claim

If you are involved in an auto accident, start by ensuring everyone’s safety and reporting the incident to the police if needed. Then contact your insurance provider as soon as possible.

To file an auto claim:
1. Log in to your online insurance account or mobile app.
2. Provide your policy number, accident date, and a short description of what happened.
3. Upload any police reports, repair estimates, or photos of the damage.

Once submitted, your claim will be reviewed by a claims adjuster who may contact you for more details. Most standard claims are processed within 7–10 business days.

If you are filing a home insurance claim, take pictures of the damage before repairs. Do not throw away damaged property until an adjuster reviews it.

Emergency claims (such as fire, flood, or severe storm) can be reported 24/7 by calling our hotline. Your deductible amount will be subtracted from the final payout.
